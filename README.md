# solarSystemMechanics
This Matlab Script simulates the motion of the different planets around the Sun in our Solar System.
In this proyect we considered the mass, velocity of the planets and the distance to the Sun.

To acomplish our goal, we had to consider Newton's Gravitational Law in each component of every planet. We had to calculate the Gravitational Law for the coordante X,Y and Z. Also, we calculated the angular velocity to later on simulate the motion around the Sun.
Conisdering all of these, we came up with differential equations that we solve using the Forth Order RK Method.
